								<h2 class="major">about</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am 21 years old from the Northern Suburbs. I was born in Australia but my parents came from Vietnam. I can speak read and write both Vietnamese and English. I completed my high school education at Penola Catholic College taking Maths Methods, Specialist Maths, Biology, Chemistry, English Language and Physics (I didn’t do well as I just gave up and was forced into doing about half those subjects by my parents.) I commenced university right after high school and was forced into the medical field by older family members. In my first 3 years of university I studied a double degree of Health Science | Osteopathy. I lost interest in the course as it contained A LOT of information and had 7-8 exams per semester due to practical and written components. I then decided to transfer to Information Technology as it was something that always interest me throughout high school and life in general. I currently work a casual job as a bartender for a restaurant and work about 10-20hrs a week. My favourite sports that I play include futsal and tennis, I try my best to attend the AusOpen every year. As for other hobbies I like to play video games and watch movies over shows. Currently I’m on the Apex Legends grind and my favourite movies of all time is the Harry Potter series. </a>.</p>

						<!-- About Me -->
						<article id="about">
							<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
							<p>I believe my interest in IT began in Year/Grade 9 as there was a compulsory IT class. In this class I remember learning a bit of flash, html and programming a robot to move on coloured lines (I forgot all this by now). Other factors that sparked my interests are the new websites, gadgets and tools that come out every year. This always fascinated me, and I truly believe that studying IT will provide many job opportunities and help better the future.
								Information Technology at RMIT was where I ended up. I decided to choose RMIT as I was already a student at RMIT and it made the process easier to transfer. I expect to learn to code, program and open my mind to a lot of creative ideas while learning undertaking this course. </a>.</p>

						<!-- Ideal Job -->
							<article id="ideal">
								<h2 class="major">My Ideal Job</h2>
								<p>As for my ideal job I would like to do creative work while travelling around the world to learn and connect with many different people and companies but also to explore the world as well. Another job I wouldn’t mind doing is working with the government. (Link: <a href="https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=c5d8ef7262a5c063&tk=1d79hr7ep108f002&from=serp&vjs=3">Here</a>) This is an example of a job I wouldn’t mind taking after graduating. The job details include working in a team and building massive transport projects. What makes this job appealing to me is the fact that it has a salary of $70,000+ as a Graduate. Another reason is because it will include working in a team, meaning I will work alongside other Graduates or workers who will also help hone my skills in the field. This job also allows me to be creative and improve this skill. Skills required for the job include being highly motivated, problem-solving capabilities, creativity and being able to work in a team. The skills I currently have include customer service, problem solving and simple computer skills such as the Microsoft programs. I plan on obtaining the remainder of the skills and qualifications while studying my course and looking for another part time job which relates to the IT area. In terms of working hours, I wouldn’t mind working a 9-5 job after graduating. I also wouldn’t mind working from home with flexible hours or as long as the job is complete. As for working individually or in a team I don’t mind either. Working in a team is great because you can pick at peoples’ minds and working individually is great because everything is on you, you don’t have to wait for others to complete their tasks or fix their errors.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Tests</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/test1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/test2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/test3.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The tests I completed include a MBTI test, a learning style test and an IQ test. All these test results really don’t mean much to me personally. This is because the questions they ask may differ to other people. Also, because the answers they have for multiple choice are very vague and I had to pick which was BEST suited for me instead of what I would have answered if it was short answered styled. An IQ test of 130 may be resulted by luck or just by the questions that were generated. 
									Teamwork wise these results may influence the team as I don’t speak my opinions really much unless I am being asked directly. This may hinder the team as my opinions and idea may improve and quickly progress work flow. When forming a team, I should take into account that I am not very self-spoken and therefore might need to find members who have more leadership qualities or that speak a lot more than I do.</p>

						<!-- Project -->
						<article id="project">
							<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
							<p>A great project idea would be to develop or help develop the next big app. As for what app I would like to develop a study app. The project would include a study app that is compatible with iOS, Android and PC. The study app will include many different components and will either be very cheap or free. The app will also have a simple user interface which will give off a welcoming vibe to all users. The app design would be the easier part of the app compared to the programming component as my programming skills aren’t very furnished yet.
								This project is very interesting as there are very few ‘great’ study apps out there nowadays and technology is the way of the future. While studying through high school I always wished that there was an app that would help me effectively take notes, keep organised and motivate me to study more. Creating a study app that is great and cheap will be the saving grace for many students in our society today.  </p>
								<p>There are many different features that my application will have and many different services it may provide. Firstly, I would like the basic concept of note taking. Similar to other apps out there my app would allow the user to take notes where ever they please, however they please. I would like to implement a camera for those who like to hand write notes, so they can take a snapshot of their notes and the app will convert the handwriting to text allowing the user to use the Find/Search function to look-up keywords quickly and efficiently. I would also like the app to enable attachments, so the user may attach handouts, downloaded files, etc… Secondly, the app will have to have cloud saving capabilities. This is a very important concept nowadays because it is very efficient to have your notes/study material whenever you go, as long as you have connection to the internet. For this to work I would like to have a decently sized cloud storage as many apps that provide this have very limited storage capabilities. Thirdly, to complement the last point I would love to have download capabilities or autosave to the cloud capabilities. This would mean that if you are travelling places where you know there isn’t internet connection you can download your notes you have so far. This would allow you to continue to work/add on notes to what you have and the application would automatically save the extra work you have done after you have reconnected to the internet. Finally the application will provide a to-do timer/list. This is where the user may input when things are due, what they have to do after they get home, etc… This may act like an alarm or like a calendar notification and help the user be very time efficient. As for the services my app would have, I would firstly allow the user to search keywords and cross reference them to any online books/sources that may help the user in their studies. This would also auto create a bibliography/reference list in any format of their choosing. Another service my application would provide is the service to connect to a free tutor or another student using the app if the user may need help with a certain keyword/topic. This service would also have an appointment booking where a user may book a session with another student to discuss topics or to ask for help. Another service the application may have is a service which provides the user with an assignment/essay check. This service would greatly help the user as they will get feedback before submitting their assignment, so they may improve their work and get optimal marks. Finally, the application will either be free or cheap <$10. This is because a price tag on applications is a big turn off for many students as they do not have much money to spend and if they do they wouldn’t not spend it on a study application. If the application were to be free it would also have a donation button to keep the application up to date similar to that of Wikipedia. </p>
								<p>There are many applications out there which may allow the creation/development of apps. Appery.io, Mobile Roadie, AppMachine and AppBuilder are examples of many software tools that may be used to create my app. Researching languages, BuildFire.js, Python and Java are the top three programming languages which are used for applications followed by the likes of PHP and C++. All these components together with a good plan, motivation and a creative mind will allow an app like this to be created. 
								<p>The development of this application will require many different skills and very precise and effective planning. Programming skills will be required and will be learnt through the IT Course at RMIT University. Creative skills will have to be applied for an optimal app production as many concepts such as User Interface has to be looked at closely and provide what is best and wanted from users. Great research techniques have to be implemented as comparison with competitors and price of production has to be taken into account when investing in the project. Finally, teamwork skills may have to be used as creating such a big global app will require more than one person for time efficiency. </p>
								If the project ends up being a success, the outcome will solve many student’s problems with apps to use. There are very few applications out there that give students what they need so they must use multiple apps. With this one app, everything is in one so students will just have one simple app they can use. This may impact the way students study in the future and help optimise their time and help them understand what they are doing at all times.
